Project: The AI Email Triage System - A Developer's Journey
This repository contains the code for an advanced AI-powered customer service assistant. But more than that, it represents a real-world journey of development, debugging, and refinement. This document tells the story of how we built it, the challenges we faced, and the lessons we learned.

The Mission: Building "Eva"
Our initial goal was ambitious: create an AI assistant named "Eva" that could do more than just classify an email. We wanted a collaborative tool that could:

Analyze a batch of customer emails at once.

Intelligently classify and prioritize them based on custom rules.

Draft high-quality, emotionally-aware responses.

Work with a human user to refine the drafts until they were perfect.

Send the final, approved email.

This is the story of how we brought Eva to life.

The Development Journey & Major Events
Building a sophisticated AI application is a process of overcoming challenges. Here are the major highlights and hurdles we encountered on our quest to build the final, working script.

Forging the Tools: The Initial Setup
We started by assembling our tools from the LangChain and Python ecosystem. The core of our application was an AI "assembly line" built with LangChain Expression Language (LCEL):

Python

chain = prompt | llm | parser
The prompt (Our Briefing Document): This was the heart of our project. Using Context Engineering, we created a detailed set of instructions telling Eva her persona, her classification rules, her prioritization logic, and the exact JSON format for her answers.

The llm (The AI Brain): We used ChatOpenAI as our powerful and reliable language model.

The parser (The Inspector): We used Pydantic and JsonOutputParser to create a strict Blueprint for the AI's response, ensuring we always got predictable, structured data back.

The Gauntlet of Bugs: A Debugging Story
Once we started running the code, we faced a series of classic programming challenges. Each one taught us a valuable lesson.

The Invisible Imposter (UnicodeDecodeError)

What Happened: Our program crashed while trying to read our .env secret file. The error UnicodeDecodeError was a mystery.

The Discovery: We learned that the .env file was saved with the wrong encoding (UTF-16) which added an invisible character (a BOM) at the beginning. The dotenv library, expecting standard UTF-8, didn't know how to read it.

The Lesson: File encoding is a real and common issue. Always save configuration files with UTF-8 encoding.

The Missing Key (LocalTokenNotFoundError)

What Happened: After fixing the encoding, the program crashed again, this time unable to find our API token.

The Discovery: We created a Final Checklist to debug the .env file itself:

Was the file named exactly .env?

Was it in the exact same folder as the script?

Did it contain the exact variable name (HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN or OPENAI_API_KEY)?

The Lesson: The environment setup is just as critical as the code itself. A tiny mistake in a filename or location can stop the whole application.

The Unpredictable AI (KeyError)

What Happened: The AI analysis worked, but the program crashed while trying to sort the results. The error was KeyError: 'High Priority'.

The Discovery: Our prompt asked for "High," "Medium," or "Low" priority, but the AI creatively responded with "High Priority." Our Python code, which was looking for an exact match, couldn't find this new key in its dictionary.

The Lesson: Never fully trust an AI's output to be perfectly precise. Your code needs to be flexible. We solved this by changing our sorting logic from an exact match to a more robust check: if 'high' in x['priority'].lower().

The Library Labyrinth (StopIteration & AttributeError)

What Happened: We encountered a series of deep, confusing errors from within the LangChain and Hugging Face libraries themselves.

The Discovery: These errors were symptoms of library version conflicts. An older version of one library was not compatible with a newer version of another.

The Lesson: The modern development ecosystem is complex. The best way to solve these issues is to perform a clean, forced update of all related packages at once: pip install -U langchain langchain-core ....

The Breakthrough: An Interactive, Collaborative Tool
After navigating the gauntlet, we had a fully working application. We then added the most powerful features:

A while True: loop to turn the script into a continuous, interactive session.

A nested while loop to create the "refinement" cycle, allowing the user to collaborate with Eva to perfect the email drafts.

A final send_email function using smtplib to give the application the real-world ability to act on its results.

The Professional Touch: Publishing to GitHub
The final step was to save our work professionally.

We created a .gitignore fileâ€”a critical step to ensure our secret .env file and virtual environment were never uploaded to the internet.

We learned the full Git workflow: git add, git commit, and finally git push.

We even solved the one-time no upstream branch error by using git push --set-upstream origin master, establishing a permanent link between our computer and our GitHub repository.

Final Thoughts
This project evolved from a simple script into a robust, interactive AI application. The journey taught us that building with AI isn't just about writing the perfect prompt; it's about careful setup, patient debugging, writing flexible code, and managing the entire development environment.Project: The AI Email Triage System - A Developer's Journey

Building a sophisticated AI application is a process of overcoming challenges. Here are the major highlights and hurdles we encountered on our quest to build the final, working script.

Forging the Tools: The Initial Setup
We started by assembling our tools from the LangChain and Python ecosystem. The core of our application was an AI "assembly line" built with LangChain Expression Language (LCEL):

Python

chain = prompt | llm | parser
The prompt (Our Briefing Document): This was the heart of our project. Using Context Engineering, we created a detailed set of instructions telling Eva her persona, her classification rules, her prioritization logic, and the exact JSON format for her answers.

The llm (The AI Brain): We used ChatOpenAI as our powerful and reliable language model.

The parser (The Inspector): We used Pydantic and JsonOutputParser to create a strict Blueprint for the AI's response, ensuring we always got predictable, structured data back.

The Gauntlet of Bugs: A Debugging Story
Once we started running the code, we faced a series of classic programming challenges. Each one taught us a valuable lesson.

The Invisible Imposter (UnicodeDecodeError)

What Happened: Our program crashed while trying to read our .env secret file. The error UnicodeDecodeError was a mystery.

The Discovery: We learned that the .env file was saved with the wrong encoding (UTF-16) which added an invisible character (a BOM) at the beginning. The dotenv library, expecting standard UTF-8, didn't know how to read it.

The Lesson: File encoding is a real and common issue. Always save configuration files with UTF-8 encoding.

The Missing Key (LocalTokenNotFoundError)

What Happened: After fixing the encoding, the program crashed again, this time unable to find our API token.

The Discovery: We created a Final Checklist to debug the .env file itself:

Was the file named exactly .env?

Was it in the exact same folder as the script?

Did it contain the exact variable name (HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN or OPENAI_API_KEY)?

The Lesson: The environment setup is just as critical as the code itself. A tiny mistake in a filename or location can stop the whole application.

The Unpredictable AI (KeyError)

What Happened: The AI analysis worked, but the program crashed while trying to sort the results. The error was KeyError: 'High Priority'.

The Discovery: Our prompt asked for "High," "Medium," or "Low" priority, but the AI creatively responded with "High Priority." Our Python code, which was looking for an exact match, couldn't find this new key in its dictionary.

The Lesson: Never fully trust an AI's output to be perfectly precise. Your code needs to be flexible. We solved this by changing our sorting logic from an exact match to a more robust check: if 'high' in x['priority'].lower().

The Library Labyrinth (StopIteration & AttributeError)

What Happened: We encountered a series of deep, confusing errors from within the LangChain and Hugging Face libraries themselves.

The Discovery: These errors were symptoms of library version conflicts. An older version of one library was not compatible with a newer version of another.

The Lesson: The modern development ecosystem is complex. The best way to solve these issues is to perform a clean, forced update of all related packages at once: pip install -U langchain langchain-core ....

The Breakthrough: An Interactive, Collaborative Tool
After navigating the gauntlet, we had a fully working application. We then added the most powerful features:

A while True: loop to turn the script into a continuous, interactive session.

A nested while loop to create the "refinement" cycle, allowing the user to collaborate with Eva to perfect the email drafts.

A final send_email function using smtplib to give the application the real-world ability to act on its results.

The Professional Touch: Publishing to GitHub
The final step was to save our work professionally.

We created a .gitignore fileâ€”a critical step to ensure our secret .env file and virtual environment were never uploaded to the internet.

We learned the full Git workflow: git add, git commit, and finally git push.

We even solved the one-time no upstream branch error by using git push --set-upstream origin master, establishing a permanent link between our computer and our GitHub repository.

Final Thoughts
This project evolved from a simple script into a robust, interactive AI application. The journey taught us that building with AI isn't just about writing the perfect prompt; it's about careful setup, patient debugging, writing flexible code, and managing the entire development environment.Project: The AI Email Triage System - A Developer's Journey
This repository contains the code for an advanced AI-powered customer service assistant. But more than that, it represents a real-world journey of development, debugging, and refinement. This document tells the story of how we built it, the challenges we faced, and the lessons we learned.

The Mission: Building "Eva"
Our initial goal was ambitious: create an AI assistant named "Eva" that could do more than just classify an email. We wanted a collaborative tool that could:

Analyze a batch of customer emails at once.

Intelligently classify and prioritize them based on custom rules.

Draft high-quality, emotionally-aware responses.

Work with a human user to refine the drafts until they were perfect.

Send the final, approved email.

The parser (The Inspector): We used Pydantic and JsonOutputParser to create a strict Blueprint for the AI's response, ensuring we always got predictable, structured data back.

The Gauntlet of Bugs: A Debugging Story
Once we started running the code, we faced a series of classic programming challenges. Each one taught us a valuable lesson.

The Invisible Imposter (UnicodeDecodeError)

What Happened: Our program crashed while trying to read our .env secret file. The error UnicodeDecodeError was a mystery.

The Discovery: We learned that the .env file was saved with the wrong encoding (UTF-16) which added an invisible character (a BOM) at the beginning. The dotenv library, expecting standard UTF-8, didn't know how to read it.

The Lesson: File encoding is a real and common issue. Always save configuration files with UTF-8 encoding.

The Missing Key (LocalTokenNotFoundError)

What Happened: After fixing the encoding, the program crashed again, this time unable to find our API token.

The Discovery: We created a Final Checklist to debug the .env file itself:

Was the file named exactly .env?

Was it in the exact same folder as the script?

Did it contain the exact variable name (HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN or OPENAI_API_KEY)?

The Lesson: The environment setup is just as critical as the code itself. A tiny mistake in a filename or location can stop the whole application.

The Unpredictable AI (KeyError)

What Happened: The AI analysis worked, but the program crashed while trying to sort the results. The error was KeyError: 'High Priority'.

The Discovery: Our prompt asked for "High," "Medium," or "Low" priority, but the AI creatively responded with "High Priority." Our Python code, which was looking for an exact match, couldn't find this new key in its dictionary.

The Lesson: Never fully trust an AI's output to be perfectly precise. Your code needs to be flexible. We solved this by changing our sorting logic from an exact match to a more robust check: if 'high' in x['priority'].lower().

The Library Labyrinth (StopIteration & AttributeError)

What Happened: We encountered a series of deep, confusing errors from within the LangChain and Hugging Face libraries themselves.

The Discovery: These errors were symptoms of library version conflicts. An older version of one library was not compatible with a newer version of another.

The Lesson: The modern development ecosystem is complex. The best way to solve these issues is to perform a clean, forced update of all related packages at once: pip install -U langchain langchain-core ....

The Breakthrough: An Interactive, Collaborative Tool
After navigating the gauntlet, we had a fully working application. We then added the most powerful features:

A while True: loop to turn the script into a continuous, interactive session.

A nested while loop to create the "refinement" cycle, allowing the user to collaborate with Eva to perfect the email drafts.

A final send_email function using smtplib to give the application the real-world ability to act on its results.

The Professional Touch: Publishing to GitHub
The final step was to save our work professionally.

We created a .gitignore fileâ€”a critical step to ensure our secret .env file and virtual environment were never uploaded to the internet.

We learned the full Git workflow: git add, git commit, and finally git push.

We even solved the one-time no upstream branch error by using git push --set-upstream origin master, establishing a permanent link between our computer and our GitHub repository.

Final Thoughts
This project evolved from a simple script into a robust, interactive AI application. The journey taught us that building with AI isn't just about writing the perfect prompt; it's about careful setup, patient debugging, writing flexible code, and managing the entire development environment.Project: The AI Email Triage System - A Developer's Journey
This repository contains the code for an advanced AI-powered customer service assistant. But more than that, it represents a real-world journey of development, debugging, and refinement. This document tells the story of how we built it, the challenges we faced, and the lessons we learned.

The Mission: Building "Eva"
Our initial goal was ambitious: create an AI assistant named "Eva" that could do more than just classify an email. We wanted a collaborative tool that could:

Analyze a batch of customer emails at once.

Intelligently classify and prioritize them based on custom rules.

Draft high-quality, emotionally-aware responses.

Work with a human user to refine the drafts until they were perfect.

Send the final, approved email.

This is the story of how we brought Eva to life.

The Development Journey & Major Events
Building a sophisticated AI application is a process of overcoming challenges. Here are the major highlights and hurdles we encountered on our quest to build the final, working script.

Forging the Tools: The Initial Setup
We started by assembling our tools from the LangChain and Python ecosystem. The core of our application was an AI "assembly line" built with LangChain Expression Language (LCEL):

Python

chain = prompt | llm | parser
