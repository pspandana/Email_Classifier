Project Documentation: Smart Email Classifier
1. The Big Idea (The Story) üí°
Imagine a super busy customer service team getting hundreds of emails every hour. Some are angry, some are happy, and some are just confusing. It's hard to know which one to answer first!

My project, the Smart Email Classifier, is an AI assistant built to help this team. It acts like a super-smart helper that reads every incoming email and, in seconds, figures out everything about it. It's like giving the support team a pair of X-ray glasses to see the true meaning and emotion behind every message.

This AI assistant has two special "superpowers":

It Thinks Step-by-Step: It doesn't just guess. It follows a checklist to analyze the email, figuring out the customer's mood, how urgent the email is, and what they really want.

It Learns from Examples: Before writing a reply, it looks at examples of great customer service responses to learn the perfect tone and style.

The goal is to help the human support agent work faster and write better, more empathetic replies.

2. How It Works: A Two-Step Process
The project works in two main phases, just like a real assistant would.

Part 1: The Analysis Phase (The Detective üïµÔ∏è)
First, the AI acts like a detective. We give it an email, and using a special set of instructions called a Chain-of-Thought Prompt, it analyzes the email by answering a specific checklist of questions:

What type of email is this?

What is the customer's mood?

How urgent is it?

What's the main point?

What should we do next?

This forces the AI to "show its work," so we can trust its conclusions.

Part 2: The Reply Phase (The Writer ‚úçÔ∏è)
Once the analysis is complete, the AI switches hats and becomes a professional writer. We give it a new set of instructions called a Few-Shot Prompt. This prompt contains:

The original email.

The AI's own step-by-step analysis from Part 1.

Examples of great replies to learn from.

Using all this information, the AI drafts a professional, helpful, and empathetic reply that is tailored to the specific situation.

3. Technical Deep Dive
This project was built using the LangChain framework to connect all the components into a logical workflow.

Core Packages Used:
langchain-openai: To connect to the ChatOpenAI model (the AI brain).

langchain-core: Provided the ChatPromptTemplate for creating our instructions and the StrOutputParser for cleaning the AI's text output.

dotenv: For securely managing the OpenAI API key.

Key LangChain Concepts Implemented:
1. Chain-of-Thought Prompting
This was the core technique used in the analysis phase. By providing a numbered list of questions in the prompt template, we force the LLM to deconstruct the problem and generate a response that follows a logical sequence. This improves the accuracy of the classification and makes the model's reasoning process transparent and easy to follow.

Technical Implementation:

analysis_prompt_template = """
You are a helpful customer support assistant...
Please analyze it by following these steps:
1.  **Email Type**: ...
2.  **Customer's Mood**: ...
3.  **Urgency Level**: ...
4.  **Summary**: ...
5.  **Next Action**: ...
"""
prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(analysis_prompt_template)

2. Few-Shot Prompting
This technique was used in the reply generation phase. By including concrete examples of high-quality input/output pairs directly within the prompt, we guide the model on the desired style, tone, and structure of its response. This is more effective than just telling the model to "be empathetic," as it learns from concrete demonstrations.

Technical Implementation:

reply_prompt_template = """
You are a professional and empathetic customer support agent...
Here are some examples of good customer service responses:
---
**Example 1: Responding to a Complaint**
*Analysis*: ...
*Good Reply*: ...
---
**Example 2: Responding to a Technical Question**
*Analysis*: ...
*Good Reply*: ...
---
Now, use the following information to write a new, personalized reply...
"""

3. Interactive Control
The final part of the project was building a simple user interface in the notebook. This code allows the user to prioritize which email to process and to define the emotional tone of the reply on the fly.

Technical Implementation:

A dictionary (sample_emails) was used to store the test data.

The input() function was used to capture user choices for both the email selection and the desired emotion.

The chosen email and emotion were then passed as variables into the chain.invoke() method, demonstrating how to dynamically control the behavior of the LangChain application at runtime.

4. What I Learned
Controlling AI Reasoning: I learned that I can guide an AI's thought process using Chain-of-Thought to get more reliable and transparent results.

Guiding AI Style: I learned how to use Few-Shot examples to effectively teach the AI the desired tone and style for its output.

Building Interactive Apps: I learned how to combine LangChain with basic Python (input(), dictionaries) to build an interactive tool where the user is in control of the AI's focus and behavior.
